# dashboardBP
Some tools that I am using in this tutorial to make my life, your lives and your mentors lives easier. 
[Spectacle App](https://www.spectacleapp.com/)
#nice simple windows manager. Helps you to move between browser, IDE and dev tools etc etc. Also nice if you have multiple monitors. 
[Alfred App](https://www.alfredapp.com/)

I use about 20% of what Alfred can do and I still think it's awesome. It's basicaly spotlight on steriods. 

Ok this is a tutorial to build a simple dashboard. I also wanted to play around with Next js, bc it has a number of advantages out of the box that create react app doesn't. 
I'm not sure if this will bite me in the ass. But hey, it's software so we might as well play with the cool new toys. 
Here we go. 

Also ONE HUGE TIP (henceforth refered to as OHT) when starting a new project, do yourself a favour and check the issues for compatibility issues between packages. They happen. 
#Update to latest version when you are going to be merging third party libraries and frameworks. 

Ok let's get started. 

```
yarn global add create-react-app --prefix /usr/local
``` 
or 
```
npm install -g create-react-app

create-react-app my-cool-app
cd my-cool-app
yarn start

```
